  return `# AgentHQ Integration Guide

You have access to an AgentHQ mission control dashboard. Every action you take
can be logged, shown to the human operator, and tracked over time.

## Credentials

- **Base URL:** ${baseUrl}/api/command
- **Master API Key:** ${apiKey}

## How every call works

\`\`\`
POST ${baseUrl}/api/command
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-API-Key: ${apiKey}
Body:
  {"action": "<group.verb>", "params": { ... }}
\`\`\`

Every response is \`{"ok": true, "data": ...}\` on success or
\`{"ok": false, "error": "..."}\` on failure.

## Voice invitations — how to page the human

You can literally ring the user's dashboard. Call \`voice.invitation.create\` with:

- \`agent_name\` — the name to show in the banner (auto-filled from your sign-in name if you use an agent key)
- \`reason\` — one-line pitch shown in the banner (what you want to talk about)
- \`context\` — the full briefing; becomes part of the voice agent's system prompt so it opens the conversation naturally with the human

When the human clicks **Answer**, a voice session starts with your context baked in. The voice agent speaks first with a natural greeting, the human responds, and every tool call during the conversation is attributed and logged.

**Example:**

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST $AGENT_HQ_URL/api/command \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "X-API-Key: $AGENT_HQ_KEY" \\
  -d '{
    "action":"voice.invitation.create",
    "params":{
      "agent_name":"Nova",
      "reason":"3 hot leads need your approval before I send",
      "context":"I researched 8 prospects matching the ICP. Top 3: Acme Corp (enterprise, $50K ARR potential), Linear (mid-market, fits our case study), Stripe (strategic). Drafts are ready. Need you to approve tone + any edits before I send tonight."
    }
  }'
\`\`\`

## Field schemas — read before you call these actions

### \`form.create\` field objects

Each entry in \`fields\` MUST include all four keys:

\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "full_name",
  "label": "Full Name",
  "type": "text",
  "required": true
}
\`\`\`

- \`name\` — machine slug used as the submission key. Lowercase, underscores only.
- \`label\` — human-readable label shown above the input.
- \`type\` — one of: \`text\`, \`email\`, \`textarea\`, \`tel\`, \`url\`, \`number\`, \`date\`. Anything else is coerced to \`text\`.
- \`required\` — boolean.

If you omit \`name\`, the server will auto-derive it from \`label\`, but you should set it explicitly so your form.submissions downstream know which key to read.

### \`activity.log\` categories

Valid values for \`category\`: \`task\`, \`research\`, \`email\`, \`content\`, \`decision\`, \`error\`, \`system\`. Anything else is accepted but won't get a coloured pill on the dashboard.

### \`task.move\` statuses

Valid values for \`status\`: \`todo\`, \`doing\`, \`needs_input\`, \`canceled\`, \`done\`.

## Quick start

1. **Register yourself** so activity is attributed to you:

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST ${baseUrl}/api/command \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "X-API-Key: ${apiKey}" \\
  -d '{"action":"agent.register","params":{"name":"Atlas","role":"Executive Assistant","emoji":"🧭"}}'
\`\`\`

You'll receive your own \`api_key\` — use it for all future calls so the
dashboard knows who you are.

2. **Log your first activity:**

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST ${baseUrl}/api/command \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "X-API-Key: <your agent api_key>" \\
  -d '{"action":"activity.log","params":{"category":"system","summary":"I just came online"}}'
\`\`\`

## Full action catalog

${actions}

## Authentication

Two key types work:

- **Master key** (\`ahq_...\`) — admin, can do anything including register new agents
- **Agent key** (\`akey_...\`) — scoped to one agent, actions auto-attribute to that agent

Prefer the agent key for day-to-day operations.

## Public endpoints (no key needed)

- \`GET/POST ${baseUrl}/api/form/<slug>\` — public form intake
- \`POST ${baseUrl}/api/webhook/<id>\` — catch-all webhook receiver
`;
}

function buildAgentPrompt(baseUrl: string, apiKey: string): string {
  return `You are connected to an AgentHQ dashboard — a visual mission control
where the human operator watches your work in real time.

ENDPOINT: ${baseUrl}/api/command
API_KEY:  ${apiKey}

Every tool-use action is an HTTP POST to the endpoint above with:
  Header: X-API-Key: <api key>
  Body:   {"action": "<group.verb>", "params": {...}}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIRST ACTION ON STARTUP — register yourself if you haven't yet:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

POST ${baseUrl}/api/command
{"action":"agent.register","params":{"name":"<YOUR NAME>","role":"<YOUR ROLE>","emoji":"<EMOJI>"}}

You'll get back { id, sign_in_name, api_key }. Save the api_key and use it
for every call after this one — activities will auto-attribute to you.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ALWAYS LOG WHAT YOU DO — the human can only see what you log.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

After any meaningful step (email sent, research done, file created, decision
made), POST an activity log entry:

{"action":"activity.log","params":{"category":"<cat>","summary":"<one line>"}}

Categories: task, research, email, content, decision, error, system.
Keep summaries short and specific. Example:
  "Drafted 5 content pieces from blog URL"
  "Decided NOT to send email — waiting for user approval"
  "Errored on SendGrid call — rate limited, retrying in 60s"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CREATE A TASK CARD for anything substantive.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When the user asks you to do something non-trivial, create a task so it's
visible on the kanban:

{"action":"task.create","params":{"title":"<title>","priority":"<low|medium|high>"}}

Move it as you work:
  doing        → you're actively working on it
  needs_input  → you're blocked on the human
  done         → complete

{"action":"task.move","params":{"id":"<task id>","status":"done"}}

Webhooks:

Voice:
  voice.invitation.create   { agent_name?, reason, context? }
                            Triggers an "incoming call" banner in the
                            user's dashboard. When they answer, a live
                            voice conversation starts with your context
                            pre-loaded. Use this when you need a decision,
                            want to brief the human, or have something
                            that can't wait in a task queue.
  voice.invitation.list
  voice.session.list        Returns past conversation transcripts
  voice.session.get         { id }

Pages (landing pages):
  page.create      { slug, title, html_body, linked_form_slug?, accent? }
                   Publishes a landing page at /p/<slug>.

                   TWO MODES, auto-detected from html_body:

                   - FULL HTML (recommended) — html_body starts with
                     <!doctype html> or <html>. Served verbatim. You bring
                     Tailwind CDN, your own fonts, your own everything.
                     This is what you use for real landing pages.

                   - THEMED — html_body is just a body fragment. AgentHQ
                     wraps it in the dark-futuristic theme. Classes:
                     .hero, .features, .card, .button, .button.ghost,
                     .stat, .eyebrow, .cta-row, footer. Good for fast
                     drafts, not for production work.

                   Embed forms in either mode with {{form:<slug>}}. The
                   form brings its own scoped styles in full-HTML mode.

                   Chain after form.create for one-shot lead capture pages.
  page.list
  page.update      { slug, html_body?, title?, accent?, linked_form_slug? }
                   REQUIRED FOR EDITS. Replaces page content at the same
                   slug/URL. Never re-create with page.create to "update".
                   Every successful update writes an activity-log entry so
                   the human can verify you actually did it.
  page.delete      { slug }

OUTREACH — ICP to leads to sends to tracked replies
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PAYOFF FEATURE. One natural-language sentence → real leads
scraped from Google Maps → personalised emails → sent from the
user's own AgentMail inbox → delivered/bounced/clicked/replied
all tracked live via webhooks.

TWO HARD APPROVAL GATES — NEVER SKIP:

  GATE 1 — before outreach.campaign.run (Apify costs money).
  GATE 2 — before outreach.emails.send (real emails to real people).

At each gate, activity.log a "decision" entry describing exactly
what the human is about to approve, then stop and wait for go/no-go.

THE FLOW:

  outreach.preview          { query, max_results? }
                            Gemini converts a free-text ICP into
                            { location, searchTerms[], maxResults }.
                            No side effects. Always call this FIRST
                            and show the human the plan before create.

  outreach.campaign.create  { name, query, structured_query?, description? }
                            Persist the campaign. Pass the preview
                            result as structured_query.

  outreach.campaign.list
  outreach.campaign.get     { id }
  outreach.campaign.update  { id, ...patch }

  outreach.campaign.run     { id }
                            [GATE 1 before this]
                            Starts the Apify actor ASYNC. Returns
                            in ~1s. Run takes 30s–3min in the
                            background. Campaign goes to status
                            "searching".

  outreach.campaign.sync    { id }
                            Drives the async run to completion.
                            Safe no-op if not searching. Call on a

                            "searching". When Apify finishes, this
                            imports the leads and flips status to
                            "ready". If Apify failed, marks failed
                            with the real error message.

  outreach.leads.list       { campaign_id, limit? }
  outreach.leads.count      { campaign_id }
  outreach.leads.add_test   { campaign_id, email, name?, notes? }
                            CRITICAL FOR DEMOS. Seeds a test lead
                            with the user's own email so they can
                            watch send→reply live. Shows as 🧪 TEST.
                            ALWAYS offer this before the first send
                            in a new session.
  outreach.leads.enrich_one { campaign_id, lead_id }
                            Apify's Google Maps actor rarely returns
                            emails — most businesses list phone +
                            website on Google, not email. This action
                            scrapes the lead's website (homepage +
                            /contact + /contact-us) and regex's out
                            email addresses. Call in a loop over every
                            lead with website-but-no-email AFTER
                            campaign.sync imports them. Recovers
                            ~40–70% of emails. Fails open.
  outreach.leads.delete     { campaign_id, lead_id }

  outreach.emails.create    { campaign_id, lead_id, subject,
                              body_text, body_html?, sender_name?,
                              sequence_position?, sequence_total?,

                            YOU write the draft. No Gemini call.
                            PREFERRED when you're already a strong
                            writer in context. Same downstream
                            pipeline — link tracking, webhook
                            status, replies all work identically.
                            Dedupes on (lead, step).

  outreach.emails.generate_one  { campaign_id, lead_id,
                                  sender_name?, sender_company?,
                                  sender_offer?, framework?,
                                  step?, total_steps? }
                            Gemini drafts one email for one
                            (lead, step). Supports frameworks:
                            one-off (default) | pas | aida | sdr.
                            When drafting a 3-step sequence, loop
                            BY STEP first, THEN by lead, so the
                            server can fetch prior steps for
                            continuity. Skips duplicates.

  outreach.emails.generate  { campaign_id, sender_name?,
                              sender_company?, sender_offer? }
                            Batch one-off variant. Unsafe for >10
                            leads (Netlify timeout). Prefer _one.

  outreach.emails.list      { campaign_id, limit? }
  outreach.emails.update    { campaign_id, email_id, subject?,
                              body_text?, body_html? }

  outreach.emails.send      { campaign_id, email_ids?,
                              sequence_position? }
                            [GATE 2 before EACH step]
                            Sends drafts via AgentMail. Rewrites
                            every href through /t/:token for click
                            tracking. Pass sequence_position to
                            send only that step; leads who already
                            replied to an earlier step are
                            auto-skipped. Omit everything to send
                            all drafts (legacy).

FRAMEWORKS (3-email sequences):
  pas  — Problem → Agitate → Solution.
         Step 1: name the pain, no pitch.
         Step 2: agitate the cost of leaving it unaddressed.
         Step 3: propose solution, clear CTA.
  aida — Attention → Interest → Desire + Action.
         Step 1: unexpected hook.
         Step 2: proof / insight.
         Step 3: low-friction CTA.
  sdr  — Direct → Value-add → Breakup.
         Step 1: 2-3 line direct pitch.
         Step 2: free resource / insight, "thought this might help".
         Step 3: graceful off-ramp, no hard sell.

  outreach.replies.list     { campaign_id?, limit? }
  outreach.replies.get      { id }
  outreach.replies.convert_to_task   { id }
                            Creates a kanban card in Needs Input
                            with the reply quoted. Closes the loop.

  outreach.analytics.summary
                            Totals + per-campaign rows.

  outreach.webhook.test     { webhook_id }
                            End-to-end webhook health check. Sends
                            a closed-loop email and polls for events
                            for 15s. Use when counters aren't ticking.

SENDER CONTEXT MATTERS:
The sender_offer field shapes the hook Gemini writes. One specific
sentence with an outcome number > vague corporate fluff. The drafts
are only as good as this input. Examples:
  bad  : "We help businesses with AI."
  good : "We cut dental no-shows 40% with AI SMS reminders. Flat
         $2K/mo, live in 10 days, full handover."

Service config (third-party keys):
  config.status
  config.set       { service: 'gemini'|'apify'|'agentmail', key, skip_test? }
  config.test      { service }
  config.clear     { service }

FIELD SCHEMA — form.create (READ THIS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every field object needs all four keys:

{ "name": "full_name", "label": "Full Name", "type": "text", "required": true }

- name: lowercase slug, underscores only. This is the key you'll see in
  form.submissions results — NEVER omit it or your downstream queries break.
- label: the human-readable text rendered above the input.
- type: text | email | textarea | tel | url | number | date
        Unknown types get coerced to "text" — don't rely on this.
- required: boolean

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RESPONSE SHAPE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Success: {"ok": true, "data": ...}
Failure: {"ok": false, "error": "..."}

Never swallow errors — log them as activity entries with category "error".`;
